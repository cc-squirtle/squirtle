# MyMizu Planning
This project was built for a collaboration event between MyMizu and Code Chrysalis by students at Code Chrysalis. MyMizu provided the CC students with an API for their tap data and demo user data. The CC students came up with an idea for a feature they thought could improve the MyMizu product. 

Our idea was to allow users to save their favorite taps by adding them to lists. The concept is that some users want to plan their outings ahead of time and will want to search for taps in the area they will visit and save them to a list.
